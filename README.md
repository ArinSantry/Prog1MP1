# Prog1MP1

The first major programming project for Programming 1, fall 2018.
This program calculates the cost of a purchase, change due, and change to be given at a donut shop.
Regular donuts cost $0.75, a dozen regular donuts cost $7.99, fancy donuts cost $0.85, and a dozen fancy donuts cost $8.49.
The user enters how many regular and fancy donuts they ordered, and the program calculates the total price of the order.
The program will then display how much the customer owes, and the user will input how much they paid.
The program calculates the change due and outputs what types of coins/bills the cashier should give the customer (e.g. if they owe $0.27 change, it will print 1 quarter, 2 pennies)
